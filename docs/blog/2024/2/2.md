# Deploying Your Own Website!

This week in my journey into the cloud, I took a deeper dive into [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/). I'll cover all that [below](#pluralsight-course), but before we get to that, I have a treat for **you**! I spent many hours this week tearing down my website and rebuilding it over and over again until I had my whole platform dialed in to a point where anyone could reuse my template to host a website of their very own.

I'm including links for each item below to use if you run into trouble, but honestly, these steps are so easy that you shouldn't need them! :D
Please message me on LinkedIn if you run into any issues. I'd love to help you get set up with your own website.

If you're just looking for my thoughts on the AWS resources I learned about this week in the PluralSight AWS Solutions Architect course, feel free to [skip over](#pluralsight-course) the following tutorial sections.

## Deploy Your Very Own Website
### Building the architecture

![build_architecture](../../../assets/build_architecture.png)

1. [Create an AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start/email)
2. [Register a domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html) with Amazon's Route 53.
3. In [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), create a stack with new resources from a template, and upload the [static_website.yml template](https://github.com/brianjstroh/strohb/blob/main/.aws/static_website.yml). Enter the domain you registered as your domain parameter. e.g. `strohb.com` for this site. Continue through the prompts using all the default settings.
4. After you initiate the stack build, you'll see an "Events" tab for your stack. Refresh that section every minute or two to follow along with your architecture being created. Once the SiteCertificate resource creation is initiated, check your email inbox in 5-15 minutes for a link to approve your domain's certificate. Click the link, then the "Approve" button. CloudFormation should then complete without any issues.
5. To bring your site online, you'll need to repoint your DNS nameservers to match your CloudFront nameservers. AWS _should_ propagate these automatically after some time, but I don't have the patience to wait 72 hours to see if AWS comes through, and you shouldn't have to wait either.

#### Reroute DNS
1. In the AWS Console, navigate to Route 53.
2. Click on your Domain registration, and then your domain name.
3. Under Details, you'll see 4 "Name servers" off to the right side.
4. We need to ensure that these match to the domain servers in your Route 53 > Hosted zone.
5. In a new tab or window, open Route 53 > Hosted zones > {your domain}.
6. Check out the 4 "Name servers" on the right side of the Hosted zone details sections.
7. In the window where you have your registerd domain details open, click the Actions > Edit name servers.
8. One by one, overwrite the existing name servers with the ones listed in your Hosted Zone.
9. Save these, and then check your domain again in your browser.

### Set Up GitHub Actions

![content_creation](../../../assets/action.png)

This is how you're going to automate content updates to your website.

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. In your forked repository, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret
3. Back in the AWS Console, let's create an access key to your s3 bucket to automate your website deployments. Navigate to IAM > Users > {stack-name}-MyS3WebsiteFullAccessUser > Security credentials > Access keys. Click Create access key, then Third-party service, then Next. Give your key a description and then "Create access key".
4. Now in your GitHub Actions secrets, name your first secret `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and copy the "Access key" value from your {stack-name}-MyS3WebsiteFullAccessUser access key into your secret value. Then hit `Add secret`.
5. Name your second secret `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and copy the "Secret access key" value from that same {stack-name}-MyS3WebsiteFullAccessUser access key into your secret value. Then hit `Add secret`.
6. Go back to your repository level in GitHub, then over to your "Actions" tab.

### Publishing Content

#### Setting up your environment

![content_creation](../../../assets/setup_environment.png)

1. If you haven't already, install Python on your computer. I recommend [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3117/) for best performance.
2. Open your favorite IDE, and in a terminal create a new virtual environment for your repository: ```python -m venv env```
3. Install `poetry`: ```pip install poetry```
4. Activate your virtual environment: ```env/scripts/activate```
5. Install mkdocs: ```poetry install --only=docs --no-root```

#### Creating your content

![content_creation](../../../assets/content_creation.png)

This section is very much tailored to hosting a [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)-built site, but if you'd rather use another platform like [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/), [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) or [Frozen-Flask](https://frozen-flask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), I'm sure you'll be able to make the necessary adjustments in .github/workflows/deploy-mkdocs.yml, docs/, and pyproject.toml.

1. Clone your forked repository down to your computer.
2. Update the `AWS_S3_BUCKET` in .github/workflows/deploy-mkdocs.yml to match your domain name.
3. Update mkdocs.yml to your liking. At a minimum, you'll need the index.md page.
4. Clear out the docs/assets/ folder, and update index.md to reflect how you want your homepage to look.
5. To preview your website, run `mkdocs serve` in a terminal, then click the link to preview your site in a local browser.
6. Once you're satisfied with how your website will look, stage, commit and push your changes up to your forked GitHub repository. The deploy-mkdocs.yml will trigger automatically on commits to your `main` branch, so you'll need to merge your branch into `main` if you're on a development branch.
7. Check your domain to see your brand new website! :D Share out with your friends.

### Troubleshooting
Run into an issue? I ran into _plenty_! With these tips, you'll be up and running in no time.

![troubleshooting](../../../assets/troubleshooting.png)


- If you're waiting on email from AWS, keep waiting. They're slow :(
- If you don't see your content hosted on your domain 2 minutes after you push your branch up to GitHub, debug in this order:
    - Did you push directly to the main branch? If not, merge your branch into the main branch.
    - Did your GitHub Action not trigger? If not, check your repository settings and enable GitHub Actions if necessary. May require another push to the main branch.
    - Do you have content in your s3 bucket? If not, check that your GitHub Action ran successfully. If it failed due to credentials, check that you have set your GitHub secrets correctly. See [Set Up GitHub Actions](#set-up-github-actions).
    - Can you access your s3 bucket directly without your domain? In the AWS Console, go to S3 > Buckets > {bucket with your domain name} > Properties > Static website hosting (very bottom). Click the link to your Bucket website endpoint. If you see your content hosted here, continue on.
    - Can you access your content via your CloudFront distribution? In the AWS Console, got to CloudFront > Distributions > {your distribution} > General > Details. Copy the Distribution domain name, and paste it into your browser. If you see your content hosted here, congratulations! There's only one place left to check. [DNS](#reroute-dns) >:)

## PluralSight Course

Some of the highlights for me this week included learning about [Kubernetes serverless architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (k8s), setting [Lifecycle Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/LifecyclePolicies.html) for AWS Elastic Container Repository images, user authentication with [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), maintaining [Infrastructure as Code](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-infrastructure-as-code-iac) with [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), and how to version control AWS resources with [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/).

With CloudFormation, I made an attempt to create a reproducible stack by importing existing resources I had set up for strohb.com. In order to do so, all existing resources being imported need to be defined exactly as they are currently configured. With my inability to trace down all CloudFormation configuration needed to match the windy route I had taken to create my existing website infrastructure, this proved to be a greater challenge than I could conquer.

On Tuesday, I decided to start from scratch with a CloudFormation-first approach. I deleted the s3 bucket hosting strohb.com, all hosted zones, my CloudFront Distribution, my automated deployment "users", and my SSL certificate. Only after the great wipeout was complete did I discover and enable AWS Config, which could have saved me a LOT of time in recreating my resources. Oh well. The lesson here is that you don't actually know how to use AWS until you can build your platform from nothing twice! 

I also took some time to implement an ECR Lifecyle Policy for our data orchestration CloudFormation stack at work. We had over 1800 stale images for our dagster deployment which were only just collecting dust.

This week I'll be wrapping up the course and working through some practice exams. Hopefully by the time my next post comes out, you'll be hearing from one of AWS' most recently certified Associate Solution Architects.
