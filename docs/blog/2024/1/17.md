# A New Beginning

## Background
For a number of reasons, I became obsessed with an MMORPG called Old School RuneScape in the latter half of 2023. OSRS a game that brings a sense of achievement, but also consumes so much time to the point where my life was becoming unbalanced.

At the same time, I was spearheading the implementation of a data orchestration platform called [`dagster`](https://dagster.io/) at work. This project has been incredibly exciting, and has already had a profound impact on the way we move and track data within our organization. Several challenges arose with implementing dagster, many of which were related to standing up a hybrid-hosted cloud deployment. An engineer at heart, I find myself wanting to understand how everything I was building actually works at a finer level.

A week ago today, I officially dropped OSRS and began a new chapter in my life - a journey into the Cloud.

## Where I'm Going

Perhaps I'm trapped in an echo chamber and I'm succumbing to confirmation bias, but I've been seeing technical articles float through my feeds on LinkedIn and through my inbox on a regular basis where developers at startups are implementing the same data architecture approach that my company has been using over the last couple of years ([example here](https://medium.com/mark-rittman/how-rittman-analytics-builds-data-stacks-for-growth-stage-businesses-using-cube-dagster-and-preset-ecfe3f0a8c89)). 

Our emerging tech stack is reliable, performat, and just plain fun to work with. Seeing upcoming tech firms adopting a similar data architecture leads me to believe that this combination of tools will lead us to build something truly incredible.

Ultimately, I'd love to be able to implement an inexpensive, full-scalable data platform for various initiatives:
- crowd-funded, open-source environmental, socio-economic, and educational data for public use such as [Data Science for Social Good](https://www.datascienceforsocialgood.org/).
- subscription model data for commercial use cases like real-estate arbitrage, social media insights, consumer analysis
- ad-funded data for "fun" use-cases like my [BrawlStars dashboard](https://github.com/brianjstroh/BrawlStars/blob/main/Brawl%20Stars%20Recommendation%20System.pdf), [Music Bingo game](https://github.com/brianjstroh/MINGO), or maybe a hiking analytics application
